# Utrack RAG Implementation: Step-by-Step Guide

This document outlines the process for implementing RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) with Pinecone and Neo4j in your existing Utrack application, with a focus on real-time event processing through RabbitMQ.

## Overview of Implementation Phases

1. **Setup Infrastructure**: Add Neo4j and Pinecone to your existing stack
2. **Create Core Services**: Implement basic RAG functionality
3. **Integrate RabbitMQ**: Set up real-time event processing
4. **Develop Analytics Features**: Implement the advanced analytics
5. **Testing and Deployment**: Validate and deploy the solution

## Phase 1: Setup Infrastructure

### Step 1: Add Neo4j to docker-compose.yaml

```markdown
I need to add Neo4j to my docker-compose.yaml for the Utrack application. The docker-compose file is located at utrack-selfhost/utrack-app/docker-compose.yaml. I want to add Neo4j as a Docker service that:

1. Uses the latest neo4j community edition image
2. Sets up proper environment variables for authentication
3. Creates necessary volumes for data persistence
4. Doesn't break my existing application services
5. Uses appropriate memory settings for a production environment

Please provide the exact service definition I should add to my docker-compose.yaml, including any environment variables I'll need to define.
```

### Step 2: Set up Pinecone environment

```markdown
I need to set up a Pinecone service for my Utrack application. Since Pinecone doesn't have an official Docker image (as it's a cloud service), I need to:

1. Create an account on Pinecone.io
2. Set up an index with appropriate dimensions (384 for all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
3. Get API keys and environment settings
4. Add these settings to my environment variables in the docker-compose.yaml

Please guide me through this process, including what environment variables I should add to my docker-compose.yaml to make the Pinecone credentials available to my services.
```

### Step 2: Add Qdrant vector database to docker-compose.yaml

```markdown
I want to use Qdrant as an open-source vector database instead of Pinecone for my Utrack application. I need to add Qdrant to my docker-compose.yaml file that:

1. Uses the official Qdrant Docker image
2. Sets up proper volumes for data persistence
3. Configures appropriate memory and CPU resources
4. Exposes the necessary ports for my application to connect
5. Includes any required environment variables

Please provide the exact service definition I should add to my docker-compose.yaml for Qdrant, including any volume configurations and environment settings to optimize it for production use.
```

### Step 3: Add dependencies to requirements.txt

```markdown
I need to update my requirements.txt file to include all necessary dependencies for implementing RAG with Neo4j and Qdrant. My application uses Python. Please provide the exact content to add to my requirements.txt file, including:

1. Qdrant client library
2. Neo4j Python driver
3. Sentence transformers for embeddings
4. Any other libraries needed for the RAG implementation

Please specify exact version numbers that are compatible with each other and stable for production use.
```

## Phase 2: Create Core Services

### Step 4: Create the risk analyzer service

3. Implements Neo4j temporal query patterns
4. Provides functions for analyzing project evolution over time
5. Implements risk evolution analysis

The implementation should follow the "Temporal Analytics" section of the RAG document, but adapted to use Qdrant's collection mechanism instead of Pinecone's namespaces.
```

### Step 13: Implement advanced analytics modules

```markdown
I need to implement the advanced analytics modules described in the document. Please create a directory structure and Python files for:

1. Team dynamics analysis
2. Predictive risk intelligence
3. Resource optimization
4. Sentiment analysis
5. Cross-project intelligence

1. Implements a central coordinator class
2. Sets up specialized agents for different analysis domains
3. Handles routing queries to appropriate agents
4. Aggregates results from multiple agents
5. Provides a unified API for client applications

The implementation should follow the "Multi-Agent Architecture for Advanced Analytics" section of the RAG document.
```

## Phase 5: Testing and Deployment

### Step 15: Create initialization scripts

```markdown
I need to create initialization scripts to set up the RAG system when first deployed. Please create a Python file named `initialize.py` that:

1. Checks if Neo4j schema exists and creates it if not
2. Checks if Qdrant collections exist and creates them if not
3. Performs an initial data load from existing sources
4. Sets up the event consumer
5. Logs the initialization process

This script should be run during the first deployment or after a reset.
```

### Step 16: Create a FastAPI interface

```markdown
I need to create a REST API to expose the RAG functionality to other services. Please create a Python file named `api.py` that:

1. Implements a FastAPI application
2. Creates endpoints for querying the RAG system
3. Creates endpoints for each major analytics function
4. Implements proper authentication and rate limiting
5. Includes OpenAPI documentation

The API should make the RAG capabilities accessible to the frontend and other services.
```

### Step 17: Update Docker configuration

```markdown
I need to finalize the Docker configuration for the risk analyzer service. Please create:

1. A complete Dockerfile for the service
2. Any necessary Docker Compose overrides
3. Environment variable templates
4. Volume configurations for persistence
