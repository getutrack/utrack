Meet [Youtrack](https://dub.sh/youtrack-website-readme), an open-source project management tool to track issues, run ~sprints~ cycles, and manage product roadmaps without the chaos of managing the tool itself. 🧘‍♀️

> Youtrack is evolving every day. Your suggestions, ideas, and reported bugs help us immensely. Do not hesitate to join in the conversation on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/A92xrEGCge) or raise a GitHub issue. We read everything and respond to most.

## ⚡ Installation

The easiest way to get started with Youtrack is by creating a [Youtrack Cloud](https://utrackapp.digi-trans.org) account.

If you would like to self-host Youtrack, please see our [deployment guide](https://utrackdocs.digi-trans.org/docker-compose).

`Instance admins` can configure instance settings with [God-mode](https://utrackdocs.digi-trans.org/instance-admin).

## 🚀 Features
